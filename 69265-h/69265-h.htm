pirate ship] were sworn to ... on a Bible.... We have an
Article which we are sworn to, which is, not to force any married
Man to serve us.... No gaming for money at cards or dice
was allowed under any circumstances. No women were allowed
on board.... When a vessel was captured, if a woman was
found on board a sentinel was placed over her immediately....

<h3>SCENE</h3>

<p><i>The rise of the curtain discloses a stage too dark to
permit the audience to be sure of more than a single
detail. This is a large brass lantern of feeble illumination;
it hangs at about the middle of the stage, a little
more than six feet above the floor, and is in motion,
swinging slightly, as in response to a turbulence which
has been made evident since a moment or two before
the curtain’s ascent. The turbulence is manifested by a
composite sound, somewhat muffled, the trampling of
feet, bellowings and angry shoutings, and a rattle of
drums; and the repeated blare of fierce trumpets. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
a girl’s voice is heard screaming in an anguish of fear
and protest; for several moments the screams are heard
above the other sounds, but end abruptly. There is a
hoarse cheering; the trumpets are blown triumphantly
to an accompaniment of drums; and then follows a short
interval of silence; after which a door at the back of
the stage is opened, a girl’s voice is heard to moan and
murmur as if she panted for breath; there is the thump
of a human body falling upon wood; and the faint light
of the lantern allows us to see an indistinct figure prostrate
upon the floor beneath it.</i></p>

<div class="hangingindent">
<p><span class="allsmcap">A HOARSE VOICE</span><br>

There, missus! P’raps you’ll have sense enough to
lay there! I never did know a prudent female make
such a commotion!<br>
<br>
(<i>Thus grumbling, the</i> <span class="smcap">Hoarse Voice</span> <i>withdraws, the
door closes, and silence follows, broken presently by
the girl’s renewed moaning. A</i> <span class="smcap">Troubled Voice</span>, <i>a
man’s, speaks huskily out of the darkness at the right
side of the stage</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE TROUBLED VOICE</span> (<i>weakly</i>)<br>

Who is that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GIRL</span> (<i>plaintively</i>)<br>

Whose voice is that?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE TROUBLED VOICE</span><br>

Is that you? Lydia?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GIRL</span> (<i>faintly</i>)<br>

Robert? Is it Robert?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>of the troubled voice</i>)<br>

Yes. They’ve lashed me beneath a table—or it might
be a bench—and it’s bolted to the deck. What of you,
Lydia?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

My hands are tied behind me. My ankles are lashed
together.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Villains!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>faintly</i>)<br>

Bloodhounds! Bloodhounds of the sea, Robert! (<i>He
groans; she goes on.</i>) When they began leaping
aboard us—ah, the horrid sight!—I saw you fighting
among them. I tried to reach you——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

I tried to come to you, Lydia!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>weeping</i>)<br>

Dear heart, I saw it!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>faintly</i>)<br>

I think my head is broke. I was struck into a swoon,
Lydia, and knew naught till I found them lashing me
beneath this bench. I can see a little. That lantern
doesn’t look like one of ours. I thought they’d brought
me to our captain’s cabin, but that lantern——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>interrupting him, faintly and with horror</i>)<br>

No, no! Robert, don’t you know where we are?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

It hasn’t the feel of our own ship.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

No; we’re in the other, Robert!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>feebly</i>)<br>

We are?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>weeping</i>)<br>

They dragged me across the rail and threw me here.
This is the pirate ship, Robert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Then may Providence have mercy on our souls!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>still weeping</i>)<br>

I saw them lay hold of my father—he tried to
struggle——<br>

(<i>She sobs.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Struggle? What could it boot? (<i>He groans.</i>) What
booted anything? From our very sighting the strange
sail we were done. No breeze for us in a flat sea—and
he, with his great crew at oars, overhauling us; he
came upon us like a shark to the body of a dead porpoise!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Hark! They’re quiet now on the deck above us.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

They have the two ships lashed together, and they’re
on ours, taking store of the plunder.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>shuddering</i>)<br>

Will they murder all our crew, Robert—(<i>with a sob</i>)—and
my father—and—and us?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>solemnly</i>)<br>

We are in the hands of Providence, Lydia.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>weeping</i>)<br>

Ah, no! In the hands of horrid pirates! (<i>She sobs;
is then quiet for a moment, and speaks in a tone of
pathetic reflection.</i>) How sudden it came upon us,
Robert!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Sudden? Aye, sudden as a tide wave in the Indy
oceans; it’ll come out of a level sea and carry away<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
half your ship while you’re taking a puff o’ your pipe!
Sudden’s the way of the sea, Lydia.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Oh, I believe it! Was it only a little while ago you
and I stood and watched the moon lift itself out of
the water so quietly?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Yes, at nightfall.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

And we were happy—and didn’t know it! We thought
we had trouble! We were afraid to tell my father that
you and I had found love together; we were afraid of
what he would say. How strange it seems now; we
thought that was trouble!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Aye, sweetheart; it’s strange.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

When they come to us how will they murder us, Robert?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>groaning</i>)<br>

I don’t know!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Will they throw us into the sea, tied as we are?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

I can’t tell!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Do you think they would be kind enough to murder
us together—if I asked them? (<i>He groans, not answering.</i>)
If I begged them, don’t you think they
might, Robert?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>in a strangled voice</i>)<br>

I—I hope so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Hark!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

What do you hear?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>faintly</i>)<br>

I think they are coming now. (<i>There is silence; then
she whispers.</i>) Hark!<br>
<br>
(<i>Silence again; after which a slight noise is heard; the
door at the back of the stage is opened and a man appears
there, carrying an iron lantern that affords a
somewhat better view of the scene and of the three
persons now animating it, though they and the place
are still indistinct, the lights insufficient and the shadows
heavy.</i><br>
<br>
<i>The cabin walls are dark wood, hung irregularly with
one or two strips of tapestry and some Oriental rugs.
In each side wall are three small square windows, now
covered by short red curtains; the ceiling, of brown
wood, is low. Against the walls are several rough sea
chests; there is a brass brazier with a grilled cover near
the center of the cabin; and against the rear wall there
is a tall cupboard, closed. A rough and heavy wooden
table, six feet long, is upon the right of the stage and
is set parallel with the side walls. Upon it are some
articles of antique pattern; a large copper bowl, a painted
wooden box with a padlock, some pewter mugs, a large
ledger and a jar of long clay pipes.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Beneath the table</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>is seen stretched upon the
floor. His wrists are lashed to the rearward legs of
the table and his ankles to the others. He is an athletic
young man, about twenty-seven, and is dressed with a
little more elegance than one might expect to see upon
the mate of a merchant ship in the year 1725, though
at present his attire and long curled hair are naturally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
much disarranged. One of the sleeves of his coat is
almost torn away; his neckwear, of linen, bordered with
lace, is in tatters; and his forehead shows a cut from
a sharp edge.</i><br>
<br>
<span class="smcap">Lydia</span>, <i>a beautiful maiden of eighteen or nineteen, is
also a little too elegant for a rough sea voyage; and
although her fineries are naturally rumpled by mishandling,
she would otherwise receive favorable mention
from the critics of St. James’s, for, like</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, <i>she
has been dressing to a lover’s eye. She now lies upon
her side beneath the central lantern, her ankles tied, her
wrists roped behind her, and her long, luxuriant curls
disordered.</i><br>
<br>
<i>The man who has just entered by the only door that
leads into the cabin—upon the left at the back—is the
pirate ship’s</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span>. <i>He is big in person, brawny,
and brown-skinned. His long, coarse, black hair hangs
about his face; a white cloth, stained with red, is bound
round his head, covering one eye; and his cheeks and
chin are blurred by two or three days’ growth of beard.
He wears a gay but soiled kerchief at his throat, a green
coat heavily ornamented with gold lace, loose yellow
breeches almost to the ankles, and is barefooted. At
his waist hangs a heavy cutlass.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>as he enters</i>)<br>

We’ll just have a better look at ye! We think belike
you’re worth lookin’ at too!<br>

(<i>He laughs chucklingly, moving to the right.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>crying out and turning so that her face is away
from him</i>)<br>

No! You shall not look at me!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>halting, surprised</i>)<br>

Eh? I didn’t mean you, missus. I mean this fine lad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
on his back here. (<i>He goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, <i>holds the
lantern near him and stares at him</i>.) Aye! A fine,
lusty young man! I thought so. You give me a bit
of a tousle, lad. It was you put this cut over my eye.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

I’d put another over the other one if I——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>laughing harshly</i>)<br>

Aye; I’d trust ye for that. I did a little to your own
head. (<i>He stoops and feels the top of</i> <span class="smcap">Robert’s</span> <i>head as
he speaks</i>.) I give ye a knob there to handle ye by.<br>

(<i>He laughs and gives a pat of his heavy hand to the
injury.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>wincing</i>)<br>

Don’t!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>repeating the pat</i>)<br>

I put a fine knob on ye.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>in pain</i>)<br>

Cut my throat and be done with it if that’s what you
came for.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>straightening up</i>)<br>

The captain’s comin’ to talk to ye.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Our captain?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>laughing</i>)<br>

I guess he’s your captain now, missus. His honor,
Captain Bimbo.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

The pirate captain?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span><br>

Aye, missus—his honor, Captain Deuteronomy Bimbo,
Esquire, commodore of all the high seas of the world<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
and president of our company of one hunder’ and
seventy-one free gen’lemen rovers and brave seamen!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>groaning</i>)<br>

Bimbo? Is it the pirate Bimbo that’s taken us?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>astonished</i>)<br>

Why, if you’re the seafarin’ body ye look to be I should
think ye’d know it. Who but Bimbo and his company
could have took a ship as neat as we took yours?
Bimbo? I should say it is Bimbo!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>despairingly</i>)<br>

Bimbo!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Is he worse than other pirates, Robert?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

We’re under the tiger’s claw, Lydia.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>)<br>

You talk like an ignorant man. (<i>Going to the windows
at the right, he begins to set back the curtains, letting
in a rosy light.</i>) Sunrise is on the way; I’ll just give
ye some light to see the “tiger” by, lad! (<i>He crosses
and opens the other curtains, talking as he does so.</i>)
And look that ye speak him respectful. It’s not every
common mate of a merchant vessel he honors with his
converse. Tiger, ye might find him, if ye scratch him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>faltering</i>)<br>

Have they—have they murdered—my father—yet?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span><br>

Which would he be now? Is it a fat old Lunnon merchantlike
man in a brindle wig and gold buckles to his
shoon?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Yes. Have they——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>dryly</i>)<br>

No. He’s not murdered yet.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Will they let me speak to him before they——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span><br>

Ask Captain Bimbo, missus. (<i>There is a flourish of
trumpets outside.</i>) That’ll be him now.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>shuddering</i>)<br>

Ah!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>groaning</i>)<br>

Bimbo!<br>

(<i>Drums beat and the trumpets sound again; then the
notorious sea rover and pirate captain</i>, <span class="smcap">Deuteronomy

<br>
<i>He is a straight-standing, lean, active man of thirty-five,
so deeply tanned that his swarthiness might make him
seem almost a mulatto; and yet, with his long, black,
carefully curled hair framing his face, he is neither an
ugly man nor, in spite of the sharp severity of his expression,
is he of an aspect obviously sinister. He is
scrupulously dressed; has fine lace at his throat; wears
a brocaded black-and-crimson coat, black silk waistcoat
and black silk breeches and stockings, with silver buckles
to his shoes. There is a dark crimson sash about his
waist, with a bandolier of the same color passing over
his left shoulder; and attached by crimson silk ribbons
to the sash and bandolier are eight pistols. He carries
no sword or cutlass, but has a great plumed hat in his
hand.</i>)</p>

Speak to her? Yes. But don’t you call her sweetheart.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>defiantly, yet with a tender accent</i>)<br>

She is my sweetheart.</p>

That may be; but don’t you call her so to-day, or I’ll
have ’em truss you down again.<br>

Was it only a little while ago—when the moon rose—and
you and I were happy, Robert?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

I think—I think life is just a moon path on the sea.
It looks all shining white and beautiful—but of a sudden
a shark’s fin glides across it. We were swimmers
in that moon path, sweet——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>interrupting fiercely</i>)<br>

Don’t you call her sweetheart!</p>

Now, look ye, I won’t be told——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

You were going to! You would have if I hadn’t stopped
you! Now I’ve warned you twice, and you take care!
(<i>He claps his hands and the</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span> <i>appears in the
doorway</i>.) Fetch me in that old merchantlike critter
with the fat paunch.<br>

(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span> <i>withdraws</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

You want my father to see it, too, when you——<br>

(<i>She looks at the glowing brazier and shudders.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>crisply</i>)<br>

The fat old merchantlike body is your father, is he?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>weeping</i>)<br>

Yes—my father.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>)<br>

And you and he the only passengers aboard. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>.)
The old man says he owns shares in your ship
and cargo.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>sullenly</i>)<br>

Yes, and in other ships and cargoes. ’Tis Mr. Driscoll,
the great Liverpool merchant, and I warn you if harm
comes to him, or to his daughter here, the whole British
Navy will——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>snarling</i>)<br>

The “whole British Navy”! The whole British Navy
is hot after me now, mate, and has been these two years.
This ship you’re sitting in I took from the whole British
Navy! Do you know what port I sailed out of when I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
first took on the honorable calling of a gentleman sea
rover?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>sullenly</i>)<br>

No, I don’t.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Marblehead. I’m a Marblehead sailorman, born in
Salem. You send the British Navy after me, meat, and
old Doytcher King Geordie in it, and I’ll have his crown
off his head and sell it for ten shillin’ in Boston market
the Monday after!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

’Tis no surprise to me that a pirate speaks treason to
his king.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

My king? I know but one king.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Aye! That’s Satan!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Satan? Now, hark ye, mate! I’ll not have Satan
mentioned lightly aboard my ship. I’ll have no blasphemy
here.<br>

(<i>He claps his hands, and a member of the pirate crew
enters quickly in response. This is a burly man of
dismaying aspect; his hair is like the mop of an Australian
bushman; he wears a shirt of gaudy calico, dirty
red cotton pantaloons, loose and long, fringed with gold
above his bare ankles, and he is so swarthy that he might
be thought a Negro. His face is a map of ancient scars;
he wears a long black beard, forked and done into two
braids tied with orange ribbon, and in his sash are two
long-handled tomahawks.</i><br>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>pouring from the decanter, speaks sternly</i>)<br>

Now, mark me. I don’t take this dram for pleasure.
(<i>He drinks; then looks at them severely.</i>) Do you
suspect me of it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>boldly</i>)<br>

No. You drink to get you in the mood for horrid deeds.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>angrily</i>)<br>

I drink because I’m cold inside. Where is that fellow?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>outside</i>)<br>

Coming, your honor; I’m here, sir.<br>

(<i>He enters, bringing by the arm an elderly and portly

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>resuming his seat at the table, glances at his ledger,

How many barrels of molasses have you got in that
ship o’ yours?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DRISCOLL</span><br>

Wretch!<br>

(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="smcap">Man with the Braided
Beard</span> <i>again growl menacingly</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>again checks them</i>)<br>

Let be, I say! (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Driscoll</span>.) How many barrels
of rum? Fourteen dozen o’ rum, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DRISCOLL</span> (<i>fiercely</i>)<br>

You bloody-minded villain! I’m as well-known on
’Change in London as the Duke o’ Marlb’ro is at Blenheim!
You’ll see Execution Dock for this; I swear it!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>warningly</i>)<br>

You have a care when and where you speak of swearing.
(<i>Looking at the ledger.</i>) I make it sixteen score
molasses, fourteen dozen rum, seventeen hogshead
Jamaica cured tobacco, thirteen hundred sixty bushel
of grain or thereabouts, mildewed and part useless; the
tobacco of poor quality and the molasses dirty. (<i>He
closes the ledger disgustedly.</i>) There’s a fine cargo for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
you! I hazard there’s not seventy pounds value that’s
worth our keeping. And yet landsmen say we have an
easy profession and envy us.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span><br>

Aye; they think all we have to do is overhaul a ship
and carry away big chests o’ gold and jewels.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Jewels! (<i>Laughs hollowly.</i>) We hain’t a jewel this
twelvemonth. (<i>Angrily to</i> <span class="smcap">Driscoll</span>.) Do you know
what we’ve got from the last seven ships we’ve taken?
Fish! Salt fish! And if there’s one thing we don’t
need it’s fish.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>violently</i>)<br>

I hate fish!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

It’s enough to make a man give up his calling! (<i>He
throws himself into a chair.</i>) Why, if I could ha’
known beforehand how many cargoes would prove just
salt fish and spoilt grain, do you think I’d ever gone
for this way of business?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>vehemently</i>)<br>

No! And neither would any young man that could
find another opening for himself.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

If a youth came to me now for guidance, asking my
advice whether or no to take up this calling, I’d bid
him think it over, I would. In the first place: How
many have the right gift for it? In the second, not one
in a thousand has the patience; and in the third, not one
in ten thousand has the gimp to persevere over the discouragements.
The youth, all confidence and ignorance,
thinks he has only to get him some brisk companions
and take rich treasure ships——</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>with a gloomy laugh</i>)<br>

Aye, so I thought when I was new at it.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Fish! Seven cargoes o’ salt fish! Seven! And now,
when we’ve been struggling on and wearing ourselves
out to improve our conditions and lay by a little something
except salt fish for our old age, all we get to
reward us is spoilt grain, bad rum, tobacco not fit to
smoke, and molasses full of dead bugs!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>hotly</i>)<br>

Yes; and if I had my way, somebody’d suffer for ’t!<br>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>behind the hand of her captor, indistinctly</i>)<br>

You did!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Man with the Braided Beard</span> <i>removes his

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>pointing to the brazier fearfully</i>)<br>

You said—that—was for me!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Because you shivered. It was because I thought you
were cold.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

You said, “Send brimstone with fire!”</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>frowning; pointing to the</i> <span class="smcap">Deaf-and-Dumb Man</span>)<br>

His name’s Brimstone. He’s Salem born, too—Brimstone
Smith.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>incredulous</i>)<br>

It wasn’t to burn me?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>annoyed</i>)<br>

It was to get you better comfort.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>relieved, but not greatly</i>)<br>

Oh! Am I just to—(<i>shuddering</i>)—to be thrown into
the sea?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>angrily</i>)<br>

What! (<i>He turns back to the table as if to control himself;
is silent a moment; then addresses his subordinates
with an air of helpless indignation.</i>) There it is!
That’s the reputation such people as Low and Lowther
and Teach get for our calling! Now you see what
comes of drinking on duty! Men like that misbehave,
and the reputation of a whole business suffers for it!
I told Lowther the last time I saw him; I said: “I
hear your crew was in liquor when they took a Portagee
vessel and went and did harm to some o’ they
poor Portagees,” I said. “Oh, well,” he says, “what
of it? They was only Portagees,” he says. “What of
it?” I asks him. “Why, there’s this of it,” I says.
“You and such as you and your crew,” I says, “you’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
get a bad name to all of us!” I says. He didn’t like it,
but I thought best to speak out to his face. And you
see I spoke true.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>gloomily</i>)<br>

So ye did! That’s it; let one or two bad uns get into
any business, soon you’ll hear everybody saying the
whole business is bad!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>crossly to</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>)<br>

Why, if we did you harm, don’t you know it would only
set people against us when they come to hear of it?
Why don’t you use your mind a little?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>vaguely and feebly</i>)<br>

My mind?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Don’t you know that men in our way of business have
got to keep the public confidence? We have to depend
on trading off our goods, don’t we? Do you suppose if
we lost the confidence of the coast folk we could hope
to prosper? (<i>Shaking his head to the</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span>.) I
declare, it’s sickening, the little that people of one walk
in life know of those in another walk in life!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span><br>

Yes, ’tis. Sickening! (<i>Here he addresses</i> <span class="smcap">Driscoll</span>, <i>in

<br>
(<span class="smcap">Driscoll</span> <i>replies with fury; but as his mouth is still obstructed
by the</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner’s</span> <i>powerful swarthy and soiled

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>sharply</i>)<br>

(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span> <i>removes his hand</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DRISCOLL</span> (<i>instantly breaking out in great fury</i>)<br>

The British Crown itself shall hear of this! He’s been

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span><br>

Stop your abuse o’ my hand!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>vehemently</i>)<br>

Shame! Close him up again! (<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span> <i>again

despite the prisoner’s struggles</i>. <span class="smcap">Bimbo</span> <i>approaches them

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>amazed and confused</i>)<br>

What it is? What day——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>severely</i>)<br>

I hope that at least you, madam, are aware that this is
the Sabbath.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>vacantly</i>)<br>

Sunday? It’s Sunday?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>sternly</i>)<br>

It is. (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Driscoll</span>.) We allow no profanity on this
vessel on the Sabbath Day. According to our interpretation,
“Blast your vitals” is profanity. Old man, if you
can’t speak without profanity—and on the Seventh Day
too—we won’t let you speak at all. Shame on you!<br>
<br>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>

(<span class="smcap">Driscoll</span> <i>struggles and mumbles under the</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner’s</span>
<i>hand</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>aghast</i>)<br>

But you’re pirates! What difference does it make to a
pi——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>annoyed, interrupting quickly</i>)<br>

Pray use another term. We are a commonwealth of
free seamen.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>breathlessly going on</i>)<br>

But what have you to do with Sunday?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

There it is!<br>

(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span> <i>groans, shaking his head, and</i> <span class="smcap">Bimbo</span>
<i>sinks despondently into a chair</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

But what could pi——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>quickly</i>)<br>

Be silent, mistress! You but show your ignorance and
rub salt in a galled wound. (<i>He clasps his forehead,
suffering; then rises, returns to his table, and speaks
resignedly.</i>) ’Tis the way o’ the universe, so why should
we complain? In all the world no man has full understanding
of any other—nor has any woman—(<i>with a
resentful side glance at</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>)—of anything, I think.
Hark ye, mistress; you’re young and may learn a little.
What is the common error of mankind?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

Why, sin.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

I said error. The common error is to misjudge all who
walk not in our own way, and to call them sinners.
Then, having called them sinners, we think they sin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
every sin. That is the common error; and now, as it is
the Seventh Day and meet for confession, I humbly confess
to be an erring creature, not above this error myself.
To make the matter plain to you, take the calling
of a play actor. Now, that is a calling abhorrent to me
from my earliest training. I look upon it as wholly
sinful and wanton and of the way to everlasting fires.
Therefore, unless I give heed to second thoughts, I
would believe any play actor guilty of all sins—a man
that would beat his wife and murder little children, perhaps
even upon the Sabbath Day. Yet, if the truth were
known, it might be found that just because a man is a
play actor he would not of his nature’s necessity and
habit do these things. Nevertheless, my first thought
would be that he would—because he is a play actor.
Fall not into the like misjudgments, mistress. Know
that our ship’s company live under rigid law and rule.
Else we could not hope to prosper. What think you
may be our company’s recreations on this day?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>bitterly</i>)<br>

I suppose they will take to gaming and to carousing on
my father’s rum.<br>

(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span> <i>and the</i> <span class="smcap">Man with the Braided
Beard</span> <i>utter short, grim laughter</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>sternly</i>)<br>

When I took my dram o’ brandy I told you it was for
no pleasure I had of it. No man of our company may
have his dram o’ Sundays except one, and that for being
cold inside him, nor may any perform any labor except
to the ship’s pressing need. For recreation—none is
permitted except the reading of some religious book.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>incredulously</i>)<br>

What!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>going on, explaining to her with gloomy patience</i>)<br>

As for gaming, neither dice nor cards shall ever be seen
on any ship of mine, I promise you. We permit no
gaming any day at all, much less upon the Seventh. So
much for that, madam!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>bitterly</i>)<br>

I see. Your only recreation is to torture your captives!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>shaking his head despondently</i>)<br>

So! (<i>He exchanges a pained, satiric smile with the</i>
<span class="smcap">Gunner</span>.) That’s all they know of us, is it? (<i>He
turns again to</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.) Young madam, again you speak
out of your ignorance. You and your father and the
young man here have given us much provocation. Have
you heard one word of profanity from us? Have you
even heard a threatening expression?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>pointing at the</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span>)<br>

He said we should be made to suffer for the badness of
our cargo.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>severely</i>)<br>

He meant a fine or toll should be levied against your
father; but that would mean our holding him here and
having his daily association with us on our ship until
the fine or ransom could be sent from Jamaica. I would
vote against it, because from what we have seen of him
I would rather go without the money.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

So you strip us of what goods we have——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>sharply</i>)<br>

Only such as we shall not be ashamed to sell to honest
folk. We shall not touch your father’s molasses. If he
was a poor man and what we levied from him deeply<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
injurious to his business, we should take up a gathering,
or collection, for him.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

You mock us!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>to the</i> <span class="smcap">Gunner</span>, <i>gloomily</i>)<br>

If no one will give you credit for it, what is the good
of a good action?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>gloomily</i>)<br>

Aye! What’s the use?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>)<br>

Now, look ye: In all our ventures from first to last,
never once have we took our toll of poor seafaring
bodies that we did not pass the hat for ’em, and every
man of our crew from captain to cook’s helper put in
something to make life brighter and give our captives
hope when we sent ’em on their way to begin their business
over again. If your father had been a poor man—and
of better morals—and if what we levy of his cargo
sorely crippled his hope to make a living, we’d do as
much for him. As it is, it’s not to be looked for.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>anxiously</i>)<br>

But will you let us go?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Why, if what a merchant captain and his crew must
expect from us is to be stripped of all and mishandled,
we’d have a fine business of it! They’d strain twice as
hard to outsail us, and fight to death afore we could
board ’em. There’s ruffians in every business that make
it harder for the good, practical men to make it pay;
but you shouldn’t judge us by the exceptions just because
the exceptions get more talked about.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>eagerly and hopefully</i>)<br>

Then you’ll put us back aboard our own ship and let
us go?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

I didn’t say that.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>crestfallen</i>)<br>

Oh!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Your father, yes. I wouldn’t keep a Sunday-swearing
man among my crew at no price! One rotten apple in
a barrel will contaminate the whole.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>anxiously</i>)<br>

And Robert and me——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

You scratched and fought or you’d not ha’ been touched.
Now that you’ve learned what becomes a respectable-manner
female, you’re not only free to go, but you must
go. By the strictest law of our commonwealth, women
are not permitted aboard except when the ship might be
in a port, and then only on Saturday afternoons and
only such as may be wife to one of the crew and accompanied
by her mother.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>anxious</i>)<br>

And Robert?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>looking</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>over</i>)<br>

This is a different matter. He’s a fine, active-bodied
seaman and knows the art of navigating. But more:
he has familiar knowledge of all the upper coast of
South America—I had it from the master of your ship—and
we design to cruise upon those coasts. He’s needful
to our company.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>piteously</i>)<br>

You mean to take him with you?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>sharply</i>)<br>

He must sign our articles and become one of our commonwealth.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>crying out</i>)<br>

No! No! No!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Why, his case is none so bad. We’ll learn him our
business, and if he’s diligent he’ll rise in it. Who can
tell? If we get better cargoes, away from this discouraging
fish and molasses belt of trade, he may come
to you in England, retired and prosperous and ready to
marry you—and all belike within seven or eight years
from now!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>wailing</i>)<br>

Seven or eight years! Seven or eight! Eight years!
Eight——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>)<br>

Ha’ done with your caterwauling, young female; we
must have him. There’s not one of us can pilot those
coasts, and ’twould endanger us to let him go.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>throwing herself on her knees before him</i>)<br>

Oh, pray don’t separate us!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

Don’t beg me! This is a commonwealth, governed by
law, and the law would depose me if I jeopardized the
common safety by turning loose this pilot. He must
sign with us. Let him speak.<br>

(<i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Deaf-and-Dumb Man</span> <i>releases</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, <i>who
rushes to</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>and helps her to her feet</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span></p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>his arms about her</i>)<br>

Don’t kneel to this ruffian for me, sweetheart.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>angrily</i>)<br>

I told you not to call her sweetheart. You do it for
pleasure, and our law forbids it on the Seventh Day.
Stand away from her! Take your arm from her! You
do that for pleasure too.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>hotly</i>)<br>

I do it to protect her.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

You don’t. It’s for pleasure, and we won’t have it.
Stand away from her, I say. (<span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>sullenly obeys</i>.)
Now we’ll fetch you to the articles of our company, and
you’ll sign ’em.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Sign ’em? I’ll die first, ten thousand times!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>hotly</i>)<br>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span><br>

That’s another oath. You use that word as profanity.
Shame! Lock him in his cabin on his own ship and let
him swear there; we can’t have it on ours. Come,
madam.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

No!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span> (<i>held by the two pirates</i>)<br>

Lydia! I shall find a way to throw myself into the sea.
(<i>Brokenly.</i>) Think of me—sometimes!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>sobbing</i>)<br>

Father, you shan’t abandon him. You don’t know—you
don’t know—you don’t know——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>sharply</i>)<br>

He doesn’t know what?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span><br>

It is his own son he abandons.</p>

His son?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

His son-in-law. We were married the night before we

Oh—oh, pshaw!<br>

(<i>He utters this with the vehemence of acute disappointment
and throws himself in a chair, completely disheartened.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span> (<i>peevishly</i>)<br>

Well, if that isn’t news to make a man sick! Just
when we thought we had a fellow could pilot us on the
richest coast in—well, it is—it’s a nuisance! (<i>To the
struggling</i> <span class="smcap">Driscoll</span>.) Come along, you!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DRISCOLL</span><br>

I won’t. (<i>Escaping for an instant, he makes at</i> <span class="smcap">Robert</span>.)
Now, blast your vitals, I’ll——</p>

Stop it!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">DRISCOLL</span><br>

Bla——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">THE GUNNER</span><br>

Shame on you! It’s worse, him being your son-in-law
and almost your own flesh and blood. Shame!</p>

He’s a bloody pirate! He’s a bl——</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>rising, gloomily</i>)<br>

No. No, he isn’t—not unless the lady consents. (<i>He
turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span> <i>appealingly</i>.) Now, if he joins us, he
might make a very good living and maybe a snug fortune<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
before middle age. (<i>Hopefully.</i>) Wouldn’t you
consent to it?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>shuddering</i>)<br>

Never!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>sighing heavily</i>)<br>

That’s the end of it, then. (<i>At the table.</i>) He’ll have
to be crossed off. (<i>He draws a line through the
scrawled signature “Robert,” and turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>.) Our
laws strictly forbid us to force a married man unless we
obtain his wife’s consent. Let him go.<br>

Robert!</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>turning upon them sharply</i>)<br>

No sweethearting, now. Stand away from her.<br>

(<span class="smcap">Robert</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Lydia</span>, <i>checked, stand looking at each
other gloomily</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">ROBERT</span><br>

Can’t I even kiss her?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>horrified</i>)<br>

Kiss your wife—on Sunday! (<i>Sternly.</i>) Where was
you brought up?</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">LYDIA</span> (<i>tenderly</i>)<br>

But you can take comfort from this: you know I want
to kiss you, Robert.</p>

<p><span class="allsmcap">BIMBO</span> (<i>crossly</i>)<br>

Well, belike he can wait till Monday. To-morrow we’ll
have what’s decent of your cargo aboard us, and you’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
be under way for England again. (<i>To the other pirates.</i>)
Take ’em all three to their own ship.<br>

I will make a short address to the crew on the subject,

What ho! Trumpets there! His honor will speak to
us on the subject, Duty! His honor will come on deck!
Trumpets!<br>

(<i>Trumpets and drums sound without.</i> <span class="smcap">Driscoll</span>, <i>struggling

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
