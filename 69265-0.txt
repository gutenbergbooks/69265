  “The ‘Articles’ [rules for the government of George Lowther’s pirate
  ship] were sworn to ... on a Bible.... We have an Article which
  we are sworn to, which is, not to force any married Man to serve
  us.... No gaming for money at cards or dice was allowed under any
  circumstances. No women were allowed on board.... When a vessel
  was captured, if a woman was found on board a sentinel was placed
  over her immediately.... _First_, You are to keep such good Orders
  among your said Briganteen’s Company that Swearing, Drunkenness
  and Prophaness be avoided, or duly Punished; And that God be duly
  worshiped.”--_The Pirates of the New England Coast_, by George

SCENE

_The rise of the curtain discloses a stage too dark to permit the
audience to be sure of more than a single detail. This is a large
brass lantern of feeble illumination; it hangs at about the middle
of the stage, a little more than six feet above the floor, and is in
motion, swinging slightly, as in response to a turbulence which has
been made evident since a moment or two before the curtain’s ascent.
The turbulence is manifested by a composite sound, somewhat muffled,
the trampling of feet, bellowings and angry shoutings, and a rattle
of drums; and the repeated blare of fierce trumpets. Then a girl’s
voice is heard screaming in an anguish of fear and protest; for several
moments the screams are heard above the other sounds, but end abruptly.
There is a hoarse cheering; the trumpets are blown triumphantly to an
accompaniment of drums; and then follows a short interval of silence;
after which a door at the back of the stage is opened, a girl’s voice
is heard to moan and murmur as if she panted for breath; there is the
thump of a human body falling upon wood; and the faint light of the
lantern allows us to see an indistinct figure prostrate upon the floor
beneath it._

A HOARSE VOICE

There, missus! P’raps you’ll have sense enough to lay there! I never
did know a prudent female make such a commotion!

(_Thus grumbling, the HOARSE VOICE withdraws, the door closes, and
silence follows, broken presently by the girl’s renewed moaning. A
TROUBLED VOICE, a man’s, speaks huskily out of the darkness at the
right side of the stage._)

THE TROUBLED VOICE (_weakly_)

Who is that?

THE GIRL (_plaintively_)

Whose voice is that?

THE TROUBLED VOICE

Is that you? Lydia?

THE GIRL (_faintly_)

Robert? Is it Robert?

ROBERT (_of the troubled voice_)

Yes. They’ve lashed me beneath a table--or it might be a bench--and
it’s bolted to the deck. What of you, Lydia?

LYDIA

My hands are tied behind me. My ankles are lashed together.

ROBERT

Villains!

LYDIA (_faintly_)

Bloodhounds! Bloodhounds of the sea, Robert! (_He groans; she goes
on._) When they began leaping aboard us--ah, the horrid sight!--I saw
you fighting among them. I tried to reach you----

ROBERT

I tried to come to you, Lydia!

LYDIA (_weeping_)

Dear heart, I saw it!

ROBERT (_faintly_)

I think my head is broke. I was struck into a swoon, Lydia, and knew
naught till I found them lashing me beneath this bench. I can see a
little. That lantern doesn’t look like one of ours. I thought they’d
brought me to our captain’s cabin, but that lantern----

LYDIA (_interrupting him, faintly and with horror_)

No, no! Robert, don’t you know where we are?

ROBERT

It hasn’t the feel of our own ship.

LYDIA

No; we’re in the other, Robert!

ROBERT (_feebly_)

We are?

LYDIA (_weeping_)

They dragged me across the rail and threw me here. This is the pirate
ship, Robert.

ROBERT

Then may Providence have mercy on our souls!

LYDIA (_still weeping_)

I saw them lay hold of my father--he tried to struggle----

(_She sobs._)

ROBERT

Struggle? What could it boot? (_He groans._) What booted anything? From
our very sighting the strange sail we were done. No breeze for us in a
flat sea--and he, with his great crew at oars, overhauling us; he came
upon us like a shark to the body of a dead porpoise!

LYDIA

Hark! They’re quiet now on the deck above us.

ROBERT

They have the two ships lashed together, and they’re on ours, taking
store of the plunder.

LYDIA (_shuddering_)

Will they murder all our crew, Robert--(_with a sob_)--and my
father--and--and us?

ROBERT (_solemnly_)

We are in the hands of Providence, Lydia.

LYDIA (_weeping_)

Ah, no! In the hands of horrid pirates! (_She sobs; is then quiet for
a moment, and speaks in a tone of pathetic reflection._) How sudden it
came upon us, Robert!

ROBERT

Sudden? Aye, sudden as a tide wave in the Indy oceans; it’ll come out
of a level sea and carry away half your ship while you’re taking a
puff o’ your pipe! Sudden’s the way of the sea, Lydia.

LYDIA

Oh, I believe it! Was it only a little while ago you and I stood and
watched the moon lift itself out of the water so quietly?

ROBERT

Yes, at nightfall.

LYDIA

And we were happy--and didn’t know it! We thought we had trouble! We
were afraid to tell my father that you and I had found love together;
we were afraid of what he would say. How strange it seems now; we
thought that was trouble!

ROBERT

Aye, sweetheart; it’s strange.

LYDIA

When they come to us how will they murder us, Robert?

ROBERT (_groaning_)

I don’t know!

LYDIA

Will they throw us into the sea, tied as we are?

ROBERT

I can’t tell!

LYDIA

Do you think they would be kind enough to murder us together--if I
asked them? (_He groans, not answering._) If I begged them, don’t you
think they might, Robert?

ROBERT (_in a strangled voice_)

I--I hope so.

LYDIA

Hark!

ROBERT

What do you hear?

LYDIA (_faintly_)

I think they are coming now. (_There is silence; then she whispers._)
Hark!

(_Silence again; after which a slight noise is heard; the door at the
back of the stage is opened and a man appears there, carrying an iron
lantern that affords a somewhat better view of the scene and of the
three persons now animating it, though they and the place are still
indistinct, the lights insufficient and the shadows heavy._

_The cabin walls are dark wood, hung irregularly with one or two strips
of tapestry and some Oriental rugs. In each side wall are three small
square windows, now covered by short red curtains; the ceiling, of
brown wood, is low. Against the walls are several rough sea chests;
there is a brass brazier with a grilled cover near the center of the
cabin; and against the rear wall there is a tall cupboard, closed.
A rough and heavy wooden table, six feet long, is upon the right of
the stage and is set parallel with the side walls. Upon it are some
articles of antique pattern; a large copper bowl, a painted wooden box
with a padlock, some pewter mugs, a large ledger and a jar of long clay
pipes._

_Beneath the table ROBERT is seen stretched upon the floor. His wrists
are lashed to the rearward legs of the table and his ankles to the
others. He is an athletic young man, about twenty-seven, and is dressed
with a little more elegance than one might expect to see upon the mate
of a merchant ship in the year 1725, though at present his attire and
long curled hair are naturally much disarranged. One of the sleeves
of his coat is almost torn away; his neckwear, of linen, bordered with
lace, is in tatters; and his forehead shows a cut from a sharp edge._

_LYDIA, a beautiful maiden of eighteen or nineteen, is also a little
too elegant for a rough sea voyage; and although her fineries are
naturally rumpled by mishandling, she would otherwise receive favorable
mention from the critics of St. James’s, for, like ROBERT, she has
been dressing to a lover’s eye. She now lies upon her side beneath the
central lantern, her ankles tied, her wrists roped behind her, and her
long, luxuriant curls disordered._

_The man who has just entered by the only door that leads into the
cabin--upon the left at the back--is the pirate ship’s GUNNER. He is
big in person, brawny, and brown-skinned. His long, coarse, black hair
hangs about his face; a white cloth, stained with red, is bound round
his head, covering one eye; and his cheeks and chin are blurred by two
or three days’ growth of beard. He wears a gay but soiled kerchief
at his throat, a green coat heavily ornamented with gold lace, loose
yellow breeches almost to the ankles, and is barefooted. At his waist
hangs a heavy cutlass._)

THE GUNNER (_as he enters_)

We’ll just have a better look at ye! We think belike you’re worth
lookin’ at too!

(_He laughs chucklingly, moving to the right._)

LYDIA (_crying out and turning so that her face is away from him_)

No! You shall not look at me!

THE GUNNER (_halting, surprised_)

Eh? I didn’t mean you, missus. I mean this fine lad on his back here.
(_He goes to ROBERT, holds the lantern near him and stares at him._)
Aye! A fine, lusty young man! I thought so. You give me a bit of a
tousle, lad. It was you put this cut over my eye.

ROBERT

I’d put another over the other one if I----

THE GUNNER (_laughing harshly_)

Aye; I’d trust ye for that. I did a little to your own head. (_He
stoops and feels the top of ROBERT’S head as he speaks._) I give ye a
knob there to handle ye by.

(_He laughs and gives a pat of his heavy hand to the injury._)

ROBERT (_wincing_)

Don’t!

THE GUNNER (_repeating the pat_)

I put a fine knob on ye.

ROBERT (_in pain_)

Cut my throat and be done with it if that’s what you came for.

THE GUNNER (_straightening up_)

The captain’s comin’ to talk to ye.

LYDIA

Our captain?

THE GUNNER (_laughing_)

I guess he’s your captain now, missus. His honor, Captain Bimbo.

LYDIA

The pirate captain?

THE GUNNER

Aye, missus--his honor, Captain Deuteronomy Bimbo, Esquire, commodore
of all the high seas of the world and president of our company of one
hunder’ and seventy-one free gen’lemen rovers and brave seamen!

ROBERT (_groaning_)

Bimbo? Is it the pirate Bimbo that’s taken us?

THE GUNNER (_astonished_)

Why, if you’re the seafarin’ body ye look to be I should think ye’d
know it. Who but Bimbo and his company could have took a ship as neat
as we took yours? Bimbo? I should say it is Bimbo!

ROBERT (_despairingly_)

Bimbo!

LYDIA

Is he worse than other pirates, Robert?

ROBERT

We’re under the tiger’s claw, Lydia.

THE GUNNER (_contemptuously_)

You talk like an ignorant man. (_Going to the windows at the right, he
begins to set back the curtains, letting in a rosy light._) Sunrise is
on the way; I’ll just give ye some light to see the “tiger” by, lad!
(_He crosses and opens the other curtains, talking as he does so._)
And look that ye speak him respectful. It’s not every common mate of a
merchant vessel he honors with his converse. Tiger, ye might find him,
if ye scratch him.

LYDIA (_faltering_)

Have they--have they murdered--my father--yet?

THE GUNNER

Which would he be now? Is it a fat old Lunnon merchantlike man in a
brindle wig and gold buckles to his shoon?

LYDIA

Yes. Have they----

THE GUNNER (_dryly_)

No. He’s not murdered yet.

LYDIA

Will they let me speak to him before they----

THE GUNNER

Ask Captain Bimbo, missus. (_There is a flourish of trumpets outside._)
That’ll be him now.

LYDIA (_shuddering_)

Ah!

ROBERT (_groaning_)

Bimbo!

(_Drums beat and the trumpets sound again; then the notorious sea rover
and pirate captain, DEUTERONOMY BIMBO, strides into the cabin and comes
to an abrupt halt, staring from one to the other of his prostrate
captives._

_He is a straight-standing, lean, active man of thirty-five, so deeply
tanned that his swarthiness might make him seem almost a mulatto;
and yet, with his long, black, carefully curled hair framing his
face, he is neither an ugly man nor, in spite of the sharp severity
of his expression, is he of an aspect obviously sinister. He is
scrupulously dressed; has fine lace at his throat; wears a brocaded
black-and-crimson coat, black silk waistcoat and black silk breeches
and stockings, with silver buckles to his shoes. There is a dark
crimson sash about his waist, with a bandolier of the same color
passing over his left shoulder; and attached by crimson silk ribbons
to the sash and bandolier are eight pistols. He carries no sword or
cutlass, but has a great plumed hat in his hand._)

BIMBO (_to the GUNNER, sharply, with a brief gesture toward ROBERT_)

Make the gentleman easy.

(_He goes on decisively to the table, tosses his hat upon it and picks
up the ledger._)

THE GUNNER

Aye, your honor. (_He proceeds at once to release ROBERT from his
lashings._) A fine, strong, active seaman he is too.

BIMBO (_growlingly_)

D’ye think I’ve no eyes?

(_He is intent upon the ledger, which he has opened._)

THE GUNNER (_continuing his task_)

I put a knob on his head for a handle to him if we need one.

(_Chuckling, he pats ROBERT’S head again. ROBERT winces, groaning._)

BIMBO

Ha’ done!

(_He seats himself at the table, studying the ledger._)

THE GUNNER (_completing his task_)

There, lad! His honor gives ye lief to stretch out the kinks in ye.

ROBERT (_rising quickly, though painfully_)

Lydia!

(_He rushes to her, bending over to unfasten her wrists._)

THE GUNNER (_following threateningly_)

Here! His honor didn’t say you could----

BIMBO (_interrupting sharply, without looking up from the ledger, in
which he has begun to write with a quill pen_)

Stand where you are. Let him alone.

(_The GUNNER instantly obeys._)

ROBERT (_untying LYDIA_)

Lydia, poor child! Lydia!

LYDIA (_whimpering_)

Poor Robert!

(_As she rises he instantly puts her behind him and stands upon the
defensive, facing the GUNNER and BIMBO._)

ROBERT (_with a gleam in his eye_)

We’re not done yet, Lydia.

(_He grips the back of a heavy wooden chair._)

THE GUNNER (_threateningly_)

What’s in your mind to do with that chair?

ROBERT (_ominously_)

I think I could kill one man with it--two, I hope.

BIMBO (_not looking up_)

Don’t lift that chair.

ROBERT (_fiercely_)

Won’t I?

(_He moves suddenly to swing the chair up as a weapon, but, although
he struggles with it, cannot move it. He groans, and the GUNNER laughs
loudly._)

THE GUNNER (_laughing_)

It’s only bolted to the deck! Heave her up, cully!

BIMBO (_still preoccupied with his writing_)

We keep the seas longer than you of the merchant ships, mate. We can’t
let much lie about loose. Don’t brain us with the chair; sit in it.
(_He glances across at them authoritatively._) You in that one, madam.
(_He points to another chair near ROBERT’S. They stare at him; he
stares back, and after a moment they obey him. BIMBO looks at ROBERT._)
I suppose you’re in a puzzle what we’ll do with you, mate.

ROBERT

I’ve faced death before this.

BIMBO (_throwing down his pen impatiently_)

You expect to have your throat cut, do you?

ROBERT (_swallowing_)

When you give the word for it. What else?

BIMBO (_to the GUNNER, angrily_)

You hear him?

THE GUNNER (_gloomily_)

Aye! It’s the way of our calling!

BIMBO (_disgustedly_)

It’s sickening! (_He gets up and paces the floor angrily for a moment
or two, then turns sharply to ROBERT._) You think that’s all we want of
a man like you--a man that fought a hundred of us when not another of
your whole ship’s company lifted a cutlass! You think all we want of
you is to slit your guzzlet, do you? Aye! You do! From the look of your
fool face I see it. Sickening!

ROBERT (_huskily_)

Then what do you want? To hang me instead of cutting my throat?

BIMBO

Faugh! (_He turns back to the table and throws himself in his chair.
The two captives watch him, terrorized, and as at some resentful
thought he strikes the table with his clenched fist, LYDIA utters a
little cry. He stares at her fiercely._) What, mistress?

LYDIA

Nothing.

(_Shivers._)

BIMBO (_gruffly to the GUNNER_)

Send us Brimstone with fire.

LYDIA (_crying out at this faintly_)

Ah!

(_The GUNNER goes out promptly._)

BIMBO

What?

LYDIA (_weakly_)

Brimstone and fire! For--what?

BIMBO

For you.

ROBERT

For her?

BIMBO

Who else? D’ye think I want ’em for me? For you, mistress!

(_He begins to apply himself to the ledger._)

LYDIA (_appealingly_)

Robert!

(_She rises, and so does ROBERT._)

ROBERT (_hoarsely_)

Lydia!

(_She clings to him._)

BIMBO (_standing up angrily_)

Stand away from that woman!

LYDIA

Robert----

BIMBO (_roaring_)

Stand away from her!

(_He overawes them, and slowly their arms fall from each other. Staring
miserably at him all the while, they resume their seats._)

BIMBO (_grunting_)

That’s better!

(_He returns to his seat and the ledger. The door opens and LYDIA and
ROBERT turn apprehensively as another pirate enters. He is dressed much
as is the GUNNER, but is gaunt and of an extreme and unnatural pallor,
his eyes glistening dishearteningly from dark hollows. He carries a pan
of smoking hot embers._)

LYDIA (_horrified_)

Robert!

(_ROBERT half rises._)

BIMBO (_fiercely_)

Sit where you are! (_ROBERT sinks into his seat. BIMBO explains._) It’s
Brimstone and hot coals that I sent for.

LYDIA (_appealing to the man with the coals_)

Don’t hurt me! Don’t hurt me! Don’t----

BIMBO

He’s deaf and dumb, mistress.

LYDIA (_choking_)

Oh!

(_The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN makes an unpleasant vocal sound, looking at
BIMBO, who points to the brazier. The man dumps his coals in the
brazier and stands beside it. The brazier glows. LYDIA and ROBERT stare
at it in anguish. The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN looks at BIMBO inquiringly,
and the latter waves his hand. The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN retires to a
position near the door. LYDIA, panting, sinks down in her chair._)

ROBERT (_hoarsely_)

I have my hands free. They shan’t touch you, sweetheart!

BIMBO (_angrily_)

Stop that!

ROBERT

I will speak to her!

BIMBO (_sharply_)

Speak to her? Yes. But don’t you call her sweetheart.

ROBERT (_defiantly, yet with a tender accent_)

She is my sweetheart.

BIMBO

That may be; but don’t you call her so to-day, or I’ll have ’em truss
you down again.

(_He again applies himself to his ledger. LYDIA again looks at the
brazier, shudders, and begins to weep spasmodically._)

LYDIA (_brokenly_)

Was it only a little while ago--when the moon rose--and you and I were
happy, Robert?

ROBERT

I think--I think life is just a moon path on the sea. It looks all
shining white and beautiful--but of a sudden a shark’s fin glides
across it. We were swimmers in that moon path, sweet----

BIMBO (_interrupting fiercely_)

Don’t you call her sweetheart!

ROBERT (_defiantly_)

Now, look ye, I won’t be told----

BIMBO

You were going to! You would have if I hadn’t stopped you! Now I’ve
warned you twice, and you take care! (_He claps his hands and the
GUNNER appears in the doorway._) Fetch me in that old merchantlike
critter with the fat paunch.

(_The GUNNER withdraws._)

LYDIA

You want my father to see it, too, when you----

(_She looks at the glowing brazier and shudders._)

BIMBO (_crisply_)

The fat old merchantlike body is your father, is he?

LYDIA (_weeping_)

Yes--my father.

BIMBO (_thoughtfully_)

And you and he the only passengers aboard. (_To ROBERT._) The old man
says he owns shares in your ship and cargo.

ROBERT (_sullenly_)

Yes, and in other ships and cargoes. ’Tis Mr. Driscoll, the great
Liverpool merchant, and I warn you if harm comes to him, or to his
daughter here, the whole British Navy will----

BIMBO (_snarling_)

The “whole British Navy”! The whole British Navy is hot after me now,
mate, and has been these two years. This ship you’re sitting in I took
from the whole British Navy! Do you know what port I sailed out of when
I first took on the honorable calling of a gentleman sea rover?

ROBERT (_sullenly_)

No, I don’t.

BIMBO

Marblehead. I’m a Marblehead sailorman, born in Salem. You send the
British Navy after me, meat, and old Doytcher King Geordie in it, and
I’ll have his crown off his head and sell it for ten shillin’ in Boston
market the Monday after!

ROBERT

’Tis no surprise to me that a pirate speaks treason to his king.

BIMBO

My king? I know but one king.

ROBERT

Aye! That’s Satan!

BIMBO

Satan? Now, hark ye, mate! I’ll not have Satan mentioned lightly aboard
my ship. I’ll have no blasphemy here.

(_He claps his hands, and a member of the pirate crew enters quickly in
response. This is a burly man of dismaying aspect; his hair is like the
mop of an Australian bushman; he wears a shirt of gaudy calico, dirty
red cotton pantaloons, loose and long, fringed with gold above his bare
ankles, and he is so swarthy that he might be thought a Negro. His face
is a map of ancient scars; he wears a long black beard, forked and
done into two braids tied with orange ribbon, and in his sash are two
long-handled tomahawks._

_BIMBO makes a gesture to the cupboard; the MAN WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD
at once fetches from there a decanter and a silver goblet upon a tray.
He places these before BIMBO and then joins the DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN,
where both glare fixedly at ROBERT and LYDIA, who have intently watched
the fetching of the liquor._)

BIMBO (_pouring from the decanter, speaks sternly_)

Now, mark me. I don’t take this dram for pleasure. (_He drinks; then
looks at them severely._) Do you suspect me of it?

ROBERT (_boldly_)

No. You drink to get you in the mood for horrid deeds.

BIMBO (_angrily_)

I drink because I’m cold inside. Where is that fellow?

THE GUNNER (_outside_)

Coming, your honor; I’m here, sir.

(_He enters, bringing by the arm an elderly and portly man dressed
in good gray cloth, with fine lace and gold buttons and buckles. His
grizzled wig is well curled round a large face, rosy with agitation. At
sight of him LYDIA springs to her feet._)

LYDIA

Father! (_She runs to him and throws her arms about him._) Oh, poor
Father!

(_She clings to him, sobbing._)

BIMBO (_impatiently_)

Enough o’ that, now! Ha’ done!

DRISCOLL (_glaring at him over LYDIA’S shoulder_)

Wretch! Horrid and bloody wretch!

(_The GUNNER and the PIRATE WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD growl fiercely and
start toward him._)

BIMBO (_checking them_)

Let be! Put her in her chair.

(_They swing her away from her father._)

ROBERT (_springing up as they lay hands upon her_)

Let her alone! I’ll----

(_He stops, finding the DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN close beside him, grinning,
and with a bare cutlass in his hand. The other two pirates put LYDIA
into her chair, where she continues to sob._)

BIMBO (_resuming his seat at the table, glances at his ledger, then
addresses DRISCOLL_)

How many barrels of molasses have you got in that ship o’ yours?

DRISCOLL

Wretch!

(_The GUNNER and the MAN WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD again growl
menacingly._)

BIMBO (_again checks them_)

Let be, I say! (_To DRISCOLL._) How many barrels of rum? Fourteen dozen
o’ rum, isn’t it?

DRISCOLL (_fiercely_)

You bloody-minded villain! I’m as well-known on ’Change in London as
the Duke o’ Marlb’ro is at Blenheim! You’ll see Execution Dock for
this; I swear it!

BIMBO (_warningly_)

You have a care when and where you speak of swearing. (_Looking at
the ledger._) I make it sixteen score molasses, fourteen dozen rum,
seventeen hogshead Jamaica cured tobacco, thirteen hundred sixty bushel
of grain or thereabouts, mildewed and part useless; the tobacco of poor
quality and the molasses dirty. (_He closes the ledger disgustedly._)
There’s a fine cargo for you! I hazard there’s not seventy pounds
value that’s worth our keeping. And yet landsmen say we have an easy
profession and envy us.

THE GUNNER

Aye; they think all we have to do is overhaul a ship and carry away big
chests o’ gold and jewels.

BIMBO

Jewels! (_Laughs hollowly._) We hain’t a jewel this twelvemonth.
(_Angrily to DRISCOLL._) Do you know what we’ve got from the last seven
ships we’ve taken? Fish! Salt fish! And if there’s one thing we don’t
need it’s fish.

THE GUNNER (_violently_)

I hate fish!

BIMBO

It’s enough to make a man give up his calling! (_He throws himself into
a chair._) Why, if I could ha’ known beforehand how many cargoes would
prove just salt fish and spoilt grain, do you think I’d ever gone for
this way of business?

THE GUNNER (_vehemently_)

No! And neither would any young man that could find another opening for
himself.

BIMBO

If a youth came to me now for guidance, asking my advice whether or no
to take up this calling, I’d bid him think it over, I would. In the
first place: How many have the right gift for it? In the second, not
one in a thousand has the patience; and in the third, not one in ten
thousand has the gimp to persevere over the discouragements. The youth,
all confidence and ignorance, thinks he has only to get him some brisk
companions and take rich treasure ships----

THE GUNNER (_with a gloomy laugh_)

Aye, so I thought when I was new at it.

BIMBO

Fish! Seven cargoes o’ salt fish! Seven! And now, when we’ve been
struggling on and wearing ourselves out to improve our conditions and
lay by a little something except salt fish for our old age, all we get
to reward us is spoilt grain, bad rum, tobacco not fit to smoke, and
molasses full of dead bugs!

THE GUNNER (_hotly_)

Yes; and if I had my way, somebody’d suffer for ’t!

(_He makes a menacing gesture toward the three captives, who are
grouped together upon the right. ROBERT sitting despondently, his
elbows on his hands; LYDIA drooping unhappily in her chair; and
DRISCOLL standing in an attitude of sturdy defiance. But at this
sinister speech of the GUNNER, and his equally ominous gesture, LYDIA
cries out faintly and begins to weep again._)

DRISCOLL (_sternly_)

Quiet, Lydia. Let these villains not believe they fright us!

LYDIA (_plaintively_)

Let them not believe they fright us? Don’t you see what they intend,
Father?

(_She glances at the brazier, shuddering._)

DRISCOLL

Be quiet.

LYDIA

Look yonder! (_Rising, she points to the brazier._) Look yonder! That
is for me. (_DRISCOLL looks at the brazier incredulously._) Don’t you
understand? That is for me! He said it was for me!

BIMBO (_roughly_)

Well, what of it? What if it is for you?

DRISCOLL (_agitated and becoming violent_)

Wretch! Would you dare?

(_He is roughly grasped and restrained by the GUNNER._)

LYDIA (_becomes hysterical_)

They mean to burn me. I can’t bear it! Oh, Robert, help me! Father!
Father!

ROBERT (_leaping to her, taking her in his arms_)

They shan’t touch you, Lydia! Sweetheart!

BIMBO (_roaring_)

Drag him away from her! Stop that!

(_The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN and the PIRATE WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD spring
upon ROBERT and LYDIA, dragging them apart and holding them fast._)

LYDIA (_stretching out her arms despairingly to ROBERT as she is
dragged from him_)

Robert, beloved----

ROBERT (_struggling to reach her_)

My love! My love forever----

DRISCOLL (_astonished and angry_)

What! What do you call each other?

BIMBO (_indignantly_)

I should think you would ask that! They have no decency at all.

LYDIA (_faintly, as the PIRATE WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD forces her again
into her chair_)

Save me, Robert! I love you!

DRISCOLL (_angrily_)

What do you?

LYDIA

I love him! They mean to burn me!

ROBERT (_struggling to reach her, though the DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN holds
him fast_)

They shall not! I say they shall not!

DRISCOLL (_fiercely, at the same time_)

You shan’t love him! (_He struggles with the GUNNER and shouts_) You
shan’t! You shan’t!

LYDIA (_writhing in her chair and screaming_)

Save me! Save me!

BIMBO (_roaring and stamping his foot_)

Silence!

(_The three pirates clap their right hands over the mouths of the three
vociferating captives, and the latter, after trying to make themselves
heard in spite of this encumbrance, relapse into a despairing
acceptance of the situation._)

BIMBO (_exasperated_)

What’s all the pother? What’s the matter with you, mistress? Who talks
of burning you?

LYDIA (_behind the hand of her captor, indistinctly_)

You did!

BIMBO

I said: Who talks of burning you? Let her speak.

(_The MAN WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD removes his hand from her mouth._)

LYDIA

You did!

BIMBO

Did what?

LYDIA (_pointing to the brazier fearfully_)

You said--that--was for me!

BIMBO

Because you shivered. It was because I thought you were cold.

LYDIA

You said, “Send brimstone with fire!”

BIMBO (_frowning; pointing to the DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN_)

His name’s Brimstone. He’s Salem born, too--Brimstone Smith.

LYDIA (_incredulous_)

It wasn’t to burn me?

BIMBO (_annoyed_)

It was to get you better comfort.

LYDIA (_relieved, but not greatly_)

Oh! Am I just to--(_shuddering_)--to be thrown into the sea?

BIMBO (_angrily_)

What! (_He turns back to the table as if to control himself; is silent
a moment; then addresses his subordinates with an air of helpless
indignation._) There it is! That’s the reputation such people as Low
and Lowther and Teach get for our calling! Now you see what comes
of drinking on duty! Men like that misbehave, and the reputation of
a whole business suffers for it! I told Lowther the last time I saw
him; I said: “I hear your crew was in liquor when they took a Portagee
vessel and went and did harm to some o’ they poor Portagees,” I said.
“Oh, well,” he says, “what of it? They was only Portagees,” he says.
“What of it?” I asks him. “Why, there’s this of it,” I says. “You and
such as you and your crew,” I says, “you’ll get a bad name to all of
us!” I says. He didn’t like it, but I thought best to speak out to his
face. And you see I spoke true.

THE GUNNER (_gloomily_)

So ye did! That’s it; let one or two bad uns get into any business,
soon you’ll hear everybody saying the whole business is bad!

BIMBO (_crossly to LYDIA_)

Why, if we did you harm, don’t you know it would only set people
against us when they come to hear of it? Why don’t you use your mind a
little?

LYDIA (_vaguely and feebly_)

My mind?

BIMBO

Don’t you know that men in our way of business have got to keep the
public confidence? We have to depend on trading off our goods, don’t
we? Do you suppose if we lost the confidence of the coast folk we could
hope to prosper? (_Shaking his head to the GUNNER._) I declare, it’s
sickening, the little that people of one walk in life know of those in
another walk in life!

THE GUNNER

Yes, ’tis. Sickening! (_Here he addresses DRISCOLL, in a tone of
annoyance as DRISCOLL has begun to renew his struggle with him._) Stand
quiet, you! What’s the matter now?

(_DRISCOLL replies with fury; but as his mouth is still obstructed by
the GUNNER’S powerful swarthy and soiled hand, proper enunciation is
impossible and no more than indignant but formless sounds are heard._)

BIMBO (_sharply_)

Let him be understood.

(_The GUNNER removes his hand._)

DRISCOLL (_instantly breaking out in great fury_)

The British Crown itself shall hear of this! He’s been working with
tar, and claps his vile hand under my nose! The smell of tar always
makes me sick. Wretch!

THE GUNNER

Stop your abuse o’ my hand!

DRISCOLL

You lay that dirty hand to my face again, and, blast your vitals,
I’ll----

BIMBO (_vehemently_)

Shame! Close him up again! (_The GUNNER again puts his hand over
DRISCOLL’S mouth and holds it there, despite the prisoner’s struggles.
BIMBO approaches them and addresses DRISCOLL severely._) Don’t you know
what day it is? Shame on you!

LYDIA (_amazed and confused_)

What it is? What day----

BIMBO (_severely_)

I hope that at least you, madam, are aware that this is the Sabbath.

LYDIA (_vacantly_)

Sunday? It’s Sunday?

BIMBO (_sternly_)

It is. (_To DRISCOLL._) We allow no profanity on this vessel on the
Sabbath Day. According to our interpretation, “Blast your vitals” is
profanity. Old man, if you can’t speak without profanity--and on the
Seventh Day too--we won’t let you speak at all. Shame on you!

(_DRISCOLL struggles and mumbles under the GUNNER’S hand._)

LYDIA (_aghast_)

But you’re pirates! What difference does it make to a pi----

BIMBO (_annoyed, interrupting quickly_)

Pray use another term. We are a commonwealth of free seamen.

LYDIA (_breathlessly going on_)

But what have you to do with Sunday?

BIMBO

There it is!

(_The GUNNER groans, shaking his head, and BIMBO sinks despondently
into a chair._)

LYDIA

But what could pi----

BIMBO (_quickly_)

Be silent, mistress! You but show your ignorance and rub salt in a
galled wound. (_He clasps his forehead, suffering; then rises, returns
to his table, and speaks resignedly._) ’Tis the way o’ the universe, so
why should we complain? In all the world no man has full understanding
of any other--nor has any woman--(_with a resentful side glance at
LYDIA_)--of anything, I think. Hark ye, mistress; you’re young and may
learn a little. What is the common error of mankind?

LYDIA

Why, sin.

BIMBO

I said error. The common error is to misjudge all who walk not in our
own way, and to call them sinners. Then, having called them sinners,
we think they sin every sin. That is the common error; and now, as
it is the Seventh Day and meet for confession, I humbly confess to be
an erring creature, not above this error myself. To make the matter
plain to you, take the calling of a play actor. Now, that is a calling
abhorrent to me from my earliest training. I look upon it as wholly
sinful and wanton and of the way to everlasting fires. Therefore,
unless I give heed to second thoughts, I would believe any play actor
guilty of all sins--a man that would beat his wife and murder little
children, perhaps even upon the Sabbath Day. Yet, if the truth were
known, it might be found that just because a man is a play actor
he would not of his nature’s necessity and habit do these things.
Nevertheless, my first thought would be that he would--because he is a
play actor. Fall not into the like misjudgments, mistress. Know that
our ship’s company live under rigid law and rule. Else we could not
hope to prosper. What think you may be our company’s recreations on
this day?

LYDIA (_bitterly_)

I suppose they will take to gaming and to carousing on my father’s rum.

(_The GUNNER and the MAN WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD utter short, grim
laughter._)

BIMBO (_sternly_)

When I took my dram o’ brandy I told you it was for no pleasure I had
of it. No man of our company may have his dram o’ Sundays except one,
and that for being cold inside him, nor may any perform any labor
except to the ship’s pressing need. For recreation--none is permitted
except the reading of some religious book.

LYDIA (_incredulously_)

What!

BIMBO (_going on, explaining to her with gloomy patience_)

As for gaming, neither dice nor cards shall ever be seen on any ship of
mine, I promise you. We permit no gaming any day at all, much less upon
the Seventh. So much for that, madam!

LYDIA (_bitterly_)

I see. Your only recreation is to torture your captives!

BIMBO (_shaking his head despondently_)

So! (_He exchanges a pained, satiric smile with the GUNNER._) That’s
all they know of us, is it? (_He turns again to LYDIA._) Young madam,
again you speak out of your ignorance. You and your father and the
young man here have given us much provocation. Have you heard one word
of profanity from us? Have you even heard a threatening expression?

LYDIA (_pointing at the GUNNER_)

He said we should be made to suffer for the badness of our cargo.

BIMBO (_severely_)

He meant a fine or toll should be levied against your father; but that
would mean our holding him here and having his daily association with
us on our ship until the fine or ransom could be sent from Jamaica. I
would vote against it, because from what we have seen of him I would
rather go without the money.

LYDIA

So you strip us of what goods we have----

BIMBO (_sharply_)

Only such as we shall not be ashamed to sell to honest folk. We shall
not touch your father’s molasses. If he was a poor man and what we
levied from him deeply injurious to his business, we should take up a
gathering, or collection, for him.

LYDIA

You mock us!

BIMBO (_to the GUNNER, gloomily_)

If no one will give you credit for it, what is the good of a good
action?

THE GUNNER (_gloomily_)

Aye! What’s the use?

BIMBO (_to LYDIA_)

Now, look ye: In all our ventures from first to last, never once have
we took our toll of poor seafaring bodies that we did not pass the hat
for ’em, and every man of our crew from captain to cook’s helper put in
something to make life brighter and give our captives hope when we sent
’em on their way to begin their business over again. If your father had
been a poor man--and of better morals--and if what we levy of his cargo
sorely crippled his hope to make a living, we’d do as much for him. As
it is, it’s not to be looked for.

LYDIA (_anxiously_)

But will you let us go?

BIMBO

Why, if what a merchant captain and his crew must expect from us is to
be stripped of all and mishandled, we’d have a fine business of it!
They’d strain twice as hard to outsail us, and fight to death afore we
could board ’em. There’s ruffians in every business that make it harder
for the good, practical men to make it pay; but you shouldn’t judge us
by the exceptions just because the exceptions get more talked about.

LYDIA (_eagerly and hopefully_)

Then you’ll put us back aboard our own ship and let us go?

BIMBO

I didn’t say that.

LYDIA (_crestfallen_)

Oh!

BIMBO

Your father, yes. I wouldn’t keep a Sunday-swearing man among my crew
at no price! One rotten apple in a barrel will contaminate the whole.

LYDIA (_anxiously_)

And Robert and me----

BIMBO

You scratched and fought or you’d not ha’ been touched. Now that you’ve
learned what becomes a respectable-manner female, you’re not only free
to go, but you must go. By the strictest law of our commonwealth, women
are not permitted aboard except when the ship might be in a port, and
then only on Saturday afternoons and only such as may be wife to one of
the crew and accompanied by her mother.

LYDIA (_anxious_)

And Robert?

BIMBO (_looking ROBERT over_)

This is a different matter. He’s a fine, active-bodied seaman and
knows the art of navigating. But more: he has familiar knowledge of
all the upper coast of South America--I had it from the master of your
ship--and we design to cruise upon those coasts. He’s needful to our
company.

LYDIA (_piteously_)

You mean to take him with you?

BIMBO (_sharply_)

He must sign our articles and become one of our commonwealth.

LYDIA (_crying out_)

No! No! No!

BIMBO

Why, his case is none so bad. We’ll learn him our business, and if he’s
diligent he’ll rise in it. Who can tell? If we get better cargoes, away
from this discouraging fish and molasses belt of trade, he may come to
you in England, retired and prosperous and ready to marry you--and all
belike within seven or eight years from now!

LYDIA (_wailing_)

Seven or eight years! Seven or eight! Eight years! Eight----

BIMBO (_uncomfortably_)

Ha’ done with your caterwauling, young female; we must have him.
There’s not one of us can pilot those coasts, and ’twould endanger us
to let him go.

LYDIA (_throwing herself on her knees before him_)

Oh, pray don’t separate us!

BIMBO

Don’t beg me! This is a commonwealth, governed by law, and the law
would depose me if I jeopardized the common safety by turning loose
this pilot. He must sign with us. Let him speak.

(_The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN releases ROBERT, who rushes to LYDIA and helps
her to her feet._)

ROBERT (_his arms about her_)

Don’t kneel to this ruffian for me, sweetheart.

BIMBO (_angrily_)

I told you not to call her sweetheart. You do it for pleasure, and our
law forbids it on the Seventh Day. Stand away from her! Take your arm
from her! You do that for pleasure too.

ROBERT (_hotly_)

I do it to protect her.

BIMBO

You don’t. It’s for pleasure, and we won’t have it. Stand away from
her, I say. (_ROBERT sullenly obeys._) Now we’ll fetch you to the
articles of our company, and you’ll sign ’em.

ROBERT

Sign ’em? I’ll die first, ten thousand times!

BIMBO (_hotly_)

You’ll sign ’em. We’ll hold you and guide your hand. (_He takes a large
and soiled parchment from the table drawer and places it upon the top
of the table._)

LYDIA (_wailing_)

You’ll make him a pirate? Oh, death were better for us both!

BIMBO

Fetch him here.

(_The DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN and the MAN WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD push ROBERT
to the table and into a chair there, where BIMBO forces a quill pen
into his hand._)

ROBERT (_as this is done_)

They shall not make me! Let me go, you black villains! I defy you!

BIMBO (_forcibly guiding his hand on the parchment_)

There! You’re writing it, my lad. “Robert.” That’s done. It’s a bad
hand, but legible. What’s your last name?

ROBERT (_panting_)

You’ll never know.

BIMBO (_grimly_)

Never mind. Robert is enough. Your hand’s been to our parchment, and
you’re one of us by law.

LYDIA (_crying out_)

Oh! Ha’ mercy!

BIMBO

Hold him here while I get the old man and his daughter back to their
own vessel. (_Moving toward the door._) Come, mistress.

LYDIA (_rushing to her father_)

Father, you can save him. You can pay ransom for him. You can promise
to send them coin from England. Father!

BIMBO (_to the GUNNER_)

Bring them with me!

LYDIA (_despairingly_)

Father, tell them you’ll pay them. Father----

ROBERT (_appealing_)

Mr. Driscoll, if you will, I’ll pay you back. I’ll save till----

DRISCOLL (_furiously as the GUNNER removes his hand from his mouth to
lead him toward the door_)

You villain! (_This is to ROBERT._) You think she’s for the likes
of you, do you? You knew I meant to wed her to her cousin Jock in
Liverpool, and you made love to her on the sly. Don’t look for help
from me. You’ve got your deserts, and I’m glad of it. You’ll hang when
they catch you, because you’re signed and made into a bloody pirate.
Why, blast you----

BIMBO (_peremptorily_)

He’s profane again. Stop him!

(_The GUNNER again claps his hand over DRISCOLL’S mouth._)

DRISCOLL (_struggling_)

You’re a bloody--bluggy----

(_The GUNNER shuts him off._)

BIMBO

That’s another oath. You use that word as profanity. Shame! Lock him in
his cabin on his own ship and let him swear there; we can’t have it on
ours. Come, madam.

LYDIA

No!

ROBERT (_held by the two pirates_)

Lydia! I shall find a way to throw myself into the sea. (_Brokenly._)
Think of me--sometimes!

LYDIA (_sobbing_)

Father, you shan’t abandon him. You don’t know--you don’t know--you
don’t know----

BIMBO (_sharply_)

He doesn’t know what?

LYDIA

It is his own son he abandons.

BIMBO (_frowning_)

His son?

LYDIA

His son-in-law. We were married the night before we sailed from Jamaica!

(_DRISCOLL struggles fiercely and utters sounds._)

BIMBO (_staring at LYDIA_)

Oh--oh, pshaw!

(_He utters this with the vehemence of acute disappointment and throws
himself in a chair, completely disheartened._)

THE GUNNER (_peevishly_)

Well, if that isn’t news to make a man sick! Just when we thought we
had a fellow could pilot us on the richest coast in--well, it is--it’s
a nuisance! (_To the struggling DRISCOLL._) Come along, you!

DRISCOLL

I won’t. (_Escaping for an instant, he makes at ROBERT._) Now, blast
your vitals, I’ll----

THE GUNNER (_again securing the captive and silencing him_)

Stop it!

DRISCOLL

Bla----

THE GUNNER

Shame on you! It’s worse, him being your son-in-law and almost your own
flesh and blood. Shame!

DRISCOLL (_indistinctly_)

He’s a bloody pirate! He’s a bl----

BIMBO (_rising, gloomily_)

No. No, he isn’t--not unless the lady consents. (_He turns to LYDIA
appealingly._) Now, if he joins us, he might make a very good living
and maybe a snug fortune before middle age. (_Hopefully._) Wouldn’t
you consent to it?

LYDIA (_shuddering_)

Never!

BIMBO (_sighing heavily_)

That’s the end of it, then. (_At the table._) He’ll have to be crossed
off. (_He draws a line through the scrawled signature “Robert,” and
turns to LYDIA._) Our laws strictly forbid us to force a married man
unless we obtain his wife’s consent. Let him go.

(_He turns aside in disappointment._)

ROBERT (_springing to LYDIA joyously_)

Lydia!

LYDIA (_rapturously_)

Robert!

BIMBO (_turning upon them sharply_)

No sweethearting, now. Stand away from her.

(_ROBERT and LYDIA, checked, stand looking at each other gloomily._)

ROBERT

Can’t I even kiss her?

BIMBO (_horrified_)

Kiss your wife--on Sunday! (_Sternly._) Where was you brought up?

LYDIA (_tenderly_)

But you can take comfort from this: you know I want to kiss you, Robert.

BIMBO (_crossly_)

Well, belike he can wait till Monday. To-morrow we’ll have what’s
decent of your cargo aboard us, and you’ll be under way for England
again. (_To the other pirates._) Take ’em all three to their own ship.

(_The GUNNER shoves DRISCOLL toward the DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN and the MAN
WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD._)

DRISCOLL (_during the moment of this release, shouting at ROBERT_)

Blast you! Bla----

BIMBO (_fiercely_)

Stop it!

(_The two pirates seize DRISCOLL; and the MAN WITH THE BRAIDED BEARD
claps his hand over his mouth. Struggling, they push and pull him to
the door._)

BIMBO (_taking up his great plumed hat from the table_)

I will make a short address to the crew on the subject, Duty!

THE GUNNER (_bellowing out of the door_)

What ho! Trumpets there! His honor will speak to us on the subject,
Duty! His honor will come on deck! Trumpets!

(_Trumpets and drums sound without. DRISCOLL, struggling and uttering
sounds, is conducted forth by the DEAF-AND-DUMB MAN. The PIRATE WITH
THE BRAIDED BEARD and the GUNNER stand by the door at salute. With a
firm gesture BIMBO puts on his hat. Then he passes toward the door.
Suddenly he halts and turns sharply upon ROBERT, who has leaned toward

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
